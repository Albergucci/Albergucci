My profiles I use every day to make gold. Some of the work i borrowed but the organization I made to my liking, which is the regular Auction House layout. 
I find things quicker and less groups honestly. 
For the crafting operations im testing out strings to look at the dbregion sale rate compared to the avg daily sold. 
So i wouldnt recommend using them still a couple things i need to figure out.
Crafted Dreadful Relics I dont have Relic 3 because crafting the regular item is the same lvl but i guess a lower requirement may come in handy so feel free to add your Relic 3s.
